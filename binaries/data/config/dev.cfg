; This file is used by the engine to decide which mods are mounted, and in what
; order. The precense of this file suppresses loading of mods in the user mod
; path (see http://trac.wildfiregames.com/wiki/GameDataPaths) if the same mod is
; present in binaries/data/mods. It also implies -noUserMod.
; This is done to make saved maps end up in the right mod folder (and in the 
; game-relative data path) to commit them later on.
